# Acoutips 2.0

## What is Acoutips?
Acoutips is a simple jQuery tooltip generator.  This version of acoutips is currently unusable and if you are looking for something to use in production please go to the master branch!

## Changes
2.0 is mostly a code review, however; I decided to try writing it in coffeescript this time.  If you do wish to contribute then please edit the .coffee file.

This version currently only supports showing and hiding.  Positioning and other features are still in development.

## Implemented Improvements
* Calling the plugin with class names as well as identifiers

## Intended Improvements
* Plugin call with no parameters
* Better/more positioning options
* Tidying up code
* Transitional effects
* Prettier default styling
* An option to click off to hide tooltip
